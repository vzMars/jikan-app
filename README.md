# Jikan App

This app uses the Jikan API to get the current top 25 manga and anime.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The user has the two button choices that use the Jikan API to fetch an array of objects containing either the top 25 anime or top 25 manga. That array of objects is then rendered onto the page for the user to see.

## Optimizations:

While this app is mobile responsive I would like to go back and improve the look of the app on mobile screens. I would also like to fetch more data using different URLs.

## Lessons Learned:

This was another great opportunity to work with APIs and use async/await. I was able to fetch an array of objects and design an app around the data I got back.
